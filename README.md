# BookIt Booking Application

## Project Description

This project is a full-stack application designed for booking and leasing apartments or locations. The goal is to create a platform where users can explore available properties, view detailed listings, and book them for specific dates. This application is currently a fun, personal project, but there is potential for a public release in the future upon completion.

### Why I Built This

I wanted to challenge myself with a full-stack project that blends UI/UX design with backend logic. The real-world application of a booking system allows me to demonstrate my skills in problem-solving, database design, and creating engaging user experiences.

### Key Features

- **Property Listings:** Display apartments or locations with photos, descriptions, availability, and price.
- **Booking Functionality:** Users can select dates and make bookings based on property availability.
- **Dynamic UI:** An engaging and responsive interface for seamless user experience, as shown in the preview above.
- **Location Categorization:** Organize listings by borough or location for better navigation.

### Technologies Used

#### Frontend:

- **React**: For building a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Bootstrap/Material-UI**: For some of the styling and layout.

#### Backend:

- **C# with ASP.NET**: For building a robust and scalable backend API.
- **Relational Database (SQL Server)**: To manage user data, bookings, and property details.

#### Hosting:

- **Azure**: Hosting the backend and database.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application to ensure easy deployment.

### Future Goals

- Implement payment gateway integration.
- Add user reviews and ratings for properties.
- Expand location options.
- Optimize performance and ensure cross-browser compatibility.
